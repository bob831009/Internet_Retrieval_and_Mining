------------
I. File List

1. train.json 		50% raw data
2. valid.json 		20% raw data
3. test.json 		30% raw data
4. vocab.json 		contains all words 
5. stopwords.json 	
6. README
7. example.json 	10 example docs

----------------
II. Notification
----------------

1. Data Date range: 2016-01-01 ~ 2016-04-30

2. stopword list is not good enough, we need to expand it in near future.

3. I did not remove low-frequency and high-frequency words from vocab.json.
	Instead, vocab.json contains all words that occur in the raw data.

4. I have extracted 'tag' from each document and those term tags can represent
	the document.

5. Instead of opening the raw data directly, you have to use python or ipython 
	to read the example.json.
